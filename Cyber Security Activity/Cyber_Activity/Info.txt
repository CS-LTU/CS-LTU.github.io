To those who dare to challenge the Shadow Nexus:

The key you seek lies within the shadows of the web.
Crack the code and follow the trail.
Once youâ€™ve unlocked the secret, trust no one, and only explore with ethics.
The answer will lead you to where phishers lurk."

Encrypted Clue:
The tools only to be used ethicly, do not use them if you are not sure.
